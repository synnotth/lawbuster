Appellant\nv.\nSTEVENSON. Respondent\n-------------\nLords Present\nLord Buckmaster\nLord Atkin\nLord T omlin\nLord Thankerton\nLord Macmillan\nJudgment\n--------\nLord Buckmaster  (read by Lord T omlin )\nMY LORDS ,\nThe facts of this case are simple.On August 26th, 1928, the Appellant drank a bottle of ginger beer, manufactured by the\nRespondent, which a friend had bought from a retailer and given to her. The bottle contained thedecomposed remains of a snail which were not and could not be detected until the greater part ofthe contents of the bottle had been consumed. As a result she alleged and, at this stage herallegations must be accepted as true, that she suffered from shock and severe gastro enteritis. Sheaccordingly instituted the proceedings against the manufacturers which have given rise to thisappeal.\nThe foundation of her case is that the Respondent, as the manufacturers of an article intended for\nconsumption and contained in a receptacle which prevented inspection owed a duty to her asconsumer of the article to take care that there was no noxious element in the goods, that theyneglected such duty and are consequently liable for any damage caused by such neglect. Aftercertain amendments which are now immaterial, the case came before the Lord Ordinary whorejected the plea in Law of the Respondent and allowed a proof. His interlocutor was revoked bythe second Division of the Court of Session from whose judgment this appeal has been brought.\nBefore examining the merits two comments are desirable \u2014Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] UKHL 100 (26 May 1932) http ://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1932/100.html\n1 of 25 5/2/2012 4:51 P M", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2107, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d323313e-b290-493b-b564-9c9ef9efdbf1": {"__data__": {"id_": "d323313e-b290-493b-b564-9c9ef9efdbf1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_path": "data\\Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 173032, "creation_date": "2024-02-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-07", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d6208d2b-16e7-4e28-ba10-3e3d58667427", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_path": "data\\Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 173032, "creation_date": "2024-02-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-07", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-07"}, "hash": "6f6298fd8c27de5ff43184326cdce08efe62ff894e15103747f4e322830c67f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "53561d7c-06dd-4a22-bc80-77d341ac4ffb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_path": "data\\Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 173032, "creation_date": "2024-02-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-07", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-07"}, "hash": "1e6e37e5cf4c549aebc5ac5577b2a0e7ff69334fc53d74e8e27acc16cd89d270", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bf2d64b4-8fcb-4310-b156-44c6221ac020", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f16fc2eb406fc17bae9c189040069070f0a4d52e47c9c54783375888ba44daa2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "(1) That the Appellant's case rests solely on the ground of a tort based not on fraud but on\nnegligence; and(2) that throughout the appeal the case has been argued on the basis, undisputed by the SecondDivision and never questioned by counsel for the Appellants or by any of your Lordships, that theEnglish and the Scots law on the subject are identical.\nIt is, therefore, upon the English law alone that I have considered the matter and in my opinion it is\non the English law alone that in the circumstances we ought to proceed.\nThe law applicable is the common law and, though. its principles are capable of application to meet\nnew conditions not contemplated when the law was laid down, yet themselves they cannot bechanged nor can additions be made to them because any particular meritorious case seems outsidetheir ambit.\nNow the common law must be sought in law books by writers of authority and in the judgments of\nthe Judges entrusted with its administration. The law books give no assistance because the work ofliving authors (however deservedly eminent cannot be used as authorities though the opinions theyexpress may demand attention, and the ancient books do not assist. I turn therefore to the decidedcases to see if they can be construed so as to support the Appellant's case. One of the earliest is thecase of Langridge v. Levy , 2 M. & W.,519. It is a case often quoted and variously explained. There\na man sold a gun which he knew was dangerous for the use of the purchaser's son. The gunexploded in the son's hands and he was held to have a right of action in tort against the gunmaker.How far it is from the present case can be seen from the judgment of Parke B. who in delivering thejudgment of the Court used these words\n\"We should pause before we make a precedent by our decision which would be an\nauthority for an action against the vendors even of such instruments and articles as aredangerous in themselves at the suit of any person whomsoever into whose hands theymight happen to pass and who should be injured thereby, and in Longmeid v. Holliday ,\n5 Ex., 761, the same eminent Judge points out that the earlier case was based on afraudulent misstatement, and he expressly repudiates the view that it has any widerapplication.\nThe case of Langridge v. Levy , therefore, can be dismissed from consideration with\nthe comment that it is rather surprising it has so often been cited for a proposition itcannot support.\nThe case of Winterbottom v. Wright , 10 M. & W., 109, is, on the other hand, an\nauthority that is closely applicable. Owing to negligence in the construction of acarriage it broke down and a stranger to the manufacture and sale sought to recoverdamages for injuries which he alleged were due to negligence in the work, and it washeld that he had no cause of action. This case seems to me to show that themanufacturer of any article is not liable to a third party injured by negligentconstruction for there can be nothing in the character of a coach to place it in a specialcategory. It may be noted also that in this case Alderson B. said \"The only safe rule isto confine the right to recover to those who enter into the contract. If we go one stepbeyond that there is no reason why we should not go fifty.\"\nLongmeid v. Holliday was the case of a defective lamp sold to a man whose wife was injured by its\nexplosion. The vendor of the lamp against whom the action was brought was not the manufacturerso that the case is not parallel to the present, but the statement of Baron Parke in his judgmentcovers the case of manufacturer for he said:\n\"It would be going much too far to say that so much care is required in the ordinary\nintercourse of life between one individual and another that if a machine not in itsnature dangerous but which might become so by a latent defect entirely unknown,although discoverable by the exercise of ordinary care, should be lent or given by oneperson, even by the manufacturer, to another, the former should be answerable to thelatter for the subsequent damage accruing by the use of it.\"", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4062, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf2d64b4-8fcb-4310-b156-44c6221ac020": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf2d64b4-8fcb-4310-b156-44c6221ac020", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_path": "data\\Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 173032, "creation_date": "2024-02-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-07", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d6208d2b-16e7-4e28-ba10-3e3d58667427", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_path": "data\\Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 173032, "creation_date": "2024-02-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-07", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-07"}, "hash": "6f6298fd8c27de5ff43184326cdce08efe62ff894e15103747f4e322830c67f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d323313e-b290-493b-b564-9c9ef9efdbf1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_path": "data\\Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 173032, "creation_date": "2024-02-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-07", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-07"}, "hash": "e543e20fc0ae3b2342499fe87db8666cf5bfcda745a72d3e57c018b695d3837d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c61bb48f-d132-4bed-b0ab-a40db4f60513", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "09cd7d3d1b39bb6d79f7b602e5ba1a539fb06a21ac6bfa8235be185f801cc524", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "If we go one stepbeyond that there is no reason why we should not go fifty.\"\nLongmeid v.

The fact in the present case that the ginger beer\noriginally left the premises of the manufacturer on a purchase as was probably the case cannot addto his duty, if such existed, to take care in its preparation.\nIt has been suggested that the statement of Baron Parke does not cover the case of negligent\nconstruction but the omission to exercise reasonable care in the discovery of a defect in themanufacture of an article where the duty of examination exists is just as negligent as the negligentconstruction itself.\nThe general principle of these cases is stated by Lord Sumner in the case of Blacker v. Lake &\nElliot , 106, L.T. 533, in these terms:\n\"The breach of the Defendant's contract with A. to use care and skill in the\nmanufacture or repair of an article does not of itself give any cause of action to B.when he is injured by reason of the article proving defective.\"\nFrom this general rule there are two Well-known exceptions\u2014\n(1) In the case of an article dangerous in itself and(2) where the article not in itself dangerous is in fact dangerous due to some defect or\nfor any other reason, and this is known to the manufacturer. Until the case of George v.\nSkivington , L.R., 5 Ex., 1,I know of no further modification of the general rule.\nAs to (1), in the case of things dangerous in themselves, there is, in the words of Lord Dunedin, \"a\npeculiar duty to take precaution imposed on those who send forth or instal such articles when it isnecessarily the case that other parties will come within their proximity\" \u2014 Dominion Gas Coy. v.\nCollins , 1909, A.C., 640. And as to (2) this depends on the fact that the knowledge of the danger\ncreates the obligation to warn, and its concealment is in the nature of fraud.\nIn this case no one can suggest the ginger beer was an article dangerous in itself, and the words of\nLord Dunedin show that the duty attaches only to such articles, for I read the words \"a peculiarduty\" as meaning a duty peculiar to the special class of subject mentioned.\nOf the remaining cases George v. Skivington is the one nearest to the present and without that case\nand the statement of Baron Cleasby in Francis v. Cockrell , L.R., 5 Q.B. 501, at p. 515, and the\ndicta of Lord Esher M.R. in Heaven v. Pender , 11 Q.B.D., 503 at pp. 500 et seq., the Appellants\nwould be destitute of authority. George v. Skivington related to the sale of a noxious hairwash and a\nclaim made by a person who had suffered from its use based on it having been negligentlycompounded was allowed. It is remarkable that Langridge v. Levy was used in support of the claim\nand influenced the judgment of all the parties to the decision; both Kelly B. and Pigott B. stressedthe fact that the article had been purchased to the knowledge of the Defendant for the use of thePlaintiff as in Langridge v. Levy , and Cleasby B. who, realising that Langridge v. Levy was decided\non the ground of fraud, said:\n\"Substitute the word 'negligent' for 'fraud' and the analogy between Langridge v. Levy\nand this case is complete\".\nIt is unnecessary to point out too emphatically that such a substitution cannot possibly be made. No\naction based on fraud can be supported by mere proof of negligence.\nI do not propose to follow the fortunes of George v. Skivington ; few cases can have lived so\ndangerously and lived so long.

The wife was considered to have a good cause ofaction and I would adopt the view which the Lord Chief Baron took in that case. Hesaid there was a duty in the vendor to use ordinary care in compounding the articlesold and that this extended to the person for whose use he knew it was purchased andtheir duty having been violated and he having failed to use reasonable care was liablein an action at the suit of the third person.\"\nIt is difficult to appreciate what is the importance of the fact that the vendor knew who was the\nperson for whom the article was purchased unless it be that the cage was treated as one of fraudand that without this element of knowledge it could not be brought within the principle ofLangridge v. Levy . Indeed this is the only view of the matter which adequately explains the\nreferences in the judgments in George v. Skivington to Langridge v. Levy and the observations of\nCleasby B. upon George v. Skivington .\nThe dicta of Lord Esher M.R. in Heaven v. Pender are rightly relied on by the Appellant. The\nmaterial passage is as follows:\n\"The proposition which these recognised cases suggest and which is therefore to be\ndeduced from them is that wherever one person is by circumstances placed in such aposition with regard to another that everyone of ordinary sense who did think would atonce recognise that if he did not use ordinary care and skill in his own c onduct with\nregard to those circumstances he would cause danger of injury to the person orproperty of the other a duty arises to use ordinary care and skill to avoid such danger.\u2026 Let us apply this proposition to the case of one person supplying goods ormachinery or instruments or utensils or the like for the purpose of their being used byanother person but with whom there is no contract as to the supply. The propositionwill stand thus: whenever one person s upplies goods or machinery or the like for the\npurpose of their being used by another person under such circumstances that everyoneof ordinary sense would if he thought recognise at once that unless he used ordinarycare and skill with regard to the c ondition of the thing supplied or the mode of\nsupplying it there w ill be danger of injury to the person or property of him for whose\nuse the thing is supplied and who is to use it a duty arises to use ordinary care and skillas to the condition or manner of supplying such thing. And for a neglect of suchordinary care or skill whereby injury happens a legal liability arises to be enforced byan action for negligence. This includes the case of goods, etc., supplied to be usedimmediately by a particular person or persons or one of a class of persons where itwould be obvious to the person supplying it if he thought that the goods would in allprobability be used at once by such persons before a reasonable opportunity for\ndiscovering any defect which might exist and where the thing supplied would be ofsuch a nature that a neglect of ordinary care or skill as to its c ondition or the manner of\nsupplying it would probably cause danger to the person or property of the person forwhose use it was supplied and who was about to use it. It would exclude a case inwhich the goods are supplied under circumstances in which it would be a chance bywhom they would be used or whether they would be used or not or whether theywould be used before there would probably be means of observing any defect or wherethe goods would be of such a nature that a want of care or sk ill as to their c ondition or\nthe manner of supplying them would not probably produce danger of injury to personor property. The cases of vendor and purchaser and lender and hirer under contractneed not be considered, as the liability arises under the contract and not merely as a\nduty imposed by law, though it may not be useless to observe that it seems difficult toimport the implied obligation into the contract except in cases in which if there were nocontract between the parties the law would according to the rule above stated implythe duty.\"\n\"The recognised cases\" to which the Master of the Rolls refers are not definitely quoted, but they\nappear to refer to cases of collision and carriage and the cases of visitation to premises on whichthere is some hidden danger, cases far removed from the doctrine he enunciates.

An unsound staging had been erected on premises to\nwhich there had been an invitation to the plaintiffs to enter and the case really depended on theduty of the owner of the premises to persons so invited. None the less it is clear that Lord Esherconsidered the cases of manufactured articles, for he examined Langridge v. Levy , and says that it\ndoes not negative the proposition that the case might nave been supported on the ground ofnegligence.\nIn the same case, however, Cotton L.J., in whose judgment Bowen L.J. concurred, said that (he was\nunwilling to concur with the Master of the Rolls in laying down unnecessarily the larger principle\nwhich he entertained inasmuch as there were many cases in which the principle was impliedlynegatived.\nHe then referred to Langridge v. Levy , and stated that it was based upon fraudulent\nmisrepresentation and had been so treated byColeridge J. in Blackmore v. Bristol and ExeterRailway Co. (8 E. & B. 1035), and that in Co llis v. Selden (2 M. & W. 519 and M. & W. 337)\nWilles J. had said that tine judgment in Langridge v. Levy was based on the fraud of the Defendant.\nThe Lord Justice then proceeded as follows:\n\"This impliedly negatives the existence of the larger general principle which is relied on\nand the decisions in Collis v. Selden and in Langmeid v. Hollidayd (in each of which\nthe plaintiff failed) are in my opinion at variance with the principle contended for. Thecase of George v. Skivington and especially what is said by Cleasby B. in giving\njudgment in that case seem to support the existence of the general principle. But it isnot in terms laid down that any such principle exists and that case was decided byCleasby B. on the ground that the negligence of the Defendant which was his ownpersonal negligence was equivalent for the purposes of that action to fraud on which(as he said) the decision in Langridge v. Levy was based. In declining to concur in\nlaying down the principle enunciated by the Master of the Rolls I in no way intimateany doubt as to the principle that anyone who leaves a dangerous instrument as a gunin such a way as to cause danger or who without due warning supplies to others for usean instrument or thing which to his knowledge from its construction or otherwise is insuch a condition as to cause danger not necessarily incident to the use of such aninstrument or, thing is liable for injury caused to others by reason of his negligent act.\"\nWith the views expressed by Cotton L.J. I agree.In Le Liecre v Gould , 1893, 1 Q.B. 491, the mortgagees of the interest of a builder under a building\nagreement advanced money to him from time to time on the faith of certificates given by a surveyorthat certain specified stages in the progress of the buildings had been reached. The surveyor wasnot appointed by the mortgagees and there was no contractual relationship between him and them.In consequence of the negligence of the surveyor the certificates contained untrue statements as tothe progress of the buildings, but there was no fraud on his part. It was held that the surveyor owedno duty to the mortgagees to exercise care in giving his certificates and they could not maintain anaction against him by reason of his negligence. In this case Lord Esher seems to have qualified tosome extent what he said in Heaven v. Pender , for at p. 497 he says this:\n\"But can the plaintiffs rely upon negligence in the absence of fraud? The question of\n\"liability for negligence ca nnot arise at all until it is established that the man who has\nbeen negligent owed some duty to the person who seeks to make him liable for hisnegligence. What duty is there when there is no relation between the parties bycontract? A man is entitled to be as negligent as he pleases towards the whole world ifhe owes no duty to them.\"\nThe case of Heaven v. Pender has no bearing upon the present question. That case established that\nunder certain circumstances one man may owe a duty to another even though there is no contractbetween them.

Heaven v. Pender goes no further than this, though it is often cited to support\nall kinds of untenable propositions.\"\nIn Earl v. Lubbock , 1905, 1 K.B. 253, the plaintiff had been injured by a wheel coming off a van\nwhich he was driving for his employer and which it was the duty of the defendant under contractwith such employer to keep in repair. The County Court Judge and the Divisional Court both heldthat even if negligence was proved the action would not lie. It was held by the Appeal Court thatthe defendant was under no duty to the plaintiff and that there was no cause of action. In hisjudgment Sir Richard Henn Collins M.R. said the case was concluded by the authority ofWinterbottom v. Wright , and he pointed out that the dictum of Lord Esher in Heaven v. Pender\nwas not a decision of the Court and that it was subsequently qualified and explained by Lord Esherhimself in Le Lievre v. Gould . Stirling L.J. said that in order to succeed in the action the plaintiff\nmust bring his case within the proposition enunciated by Cotton L.J. and agreed to by Bowen L.J.in Heaven v. Pender , while Mathew L.J. made the following observation:\n\"The argument of counsel for the plaintiff was that the defendant's servants had been\nnegligent in the performance of the contract with the owners of the van and that itfollowed as a matter of law that anyone in their employment or indeed anyone elsewho sustained an injury traceable to that negligence had a cause of action against thedefendant. It is impossible to accept such a wide proposition and indeed it is difficult tosee ' how if it were the law trade could be carried on. No prudent man would contractto make or repair what the employer intended to permit others to use in the way of histrade.\"\nIn Bates v. Batey & Co. Ld., 1913, 3 K.B. 351, the defendants, ginger beer manufacturers, were\nheld not liable to a consumer (who had purchased from a retailer one of their bottles) for injuryoccasioned by the bottle bursting as the result of a defect of which the defendants did not know, butwhich by the exercise of reasonable care they could have discovered. In reaching this conclusionMr. Justice Horridge stated that he thought the judgments of Parke B. in Langmeid v. Hollidayd , of\nCotton and Bowen L.JJ. in Heaven v. Pender , of Stirling L.J. in Earl v. Lubbock , and of Hamilton\nJ. in Blacker v. Lake and Elliot, made it clear that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, and thathe had not felt himself bound by George v. Skivington .\nSo far therefore as the case of George v. Skivington and the dicta in Heaven v. Pender are\nconcerned it is in my opinion better that they should be buried so securely that their perturbedspirits shall no longer vex the law.\nOne further case mentioned in argument may be referred to certainly not by way of authority but to\ngain assistance by considering how similar cases are dealt with by eminent judges of the J.S. A.That such cases can have no close application and no authority is clear, for though the source of thelaw in the two countries may be the same, its current may well flow in different channels.

Nor can the doctrine be confined tocases where inspection is difficult or impossible to introduce. This conception is simply to misapplyto tort doctrines applicable to sale and purchase.\nThe principle of tort lies completely outside the region where such considerations apply and the\nduty, if it exists, must extend to every person who, in lawful circumstances, uses the article made.There can be no special duty attaching to the manufacture of food, apart from that implied bycontract or imposed by statute. If such a duty exists it seems to me it must cover the construction ofevery article, and I cannot see any reason why it should not apply to the construction of a house. Ifone step why not fifty? Yet if a house be, as it sometimes is, negligently built, and in consequenceof that negligence the ceiling falls and injures the occupier or any one else, no action against thebuilder exists according to the English law, although I believe such a right did. exist according tothe laws of Babylon. Were such a principle known and recognised, it seems to me impossible,having regard to the numerous cases that must have arisen to persons injured by its disregard, thatwith the exception of George v. Skivington , no case directly involving the principle has ever\nsucceeded in the Courts, and were it well known and accepted much of the discussion of the earliercases would have been waste of time.\nIn Mullin v.

It is obvious that if such responsib ility attached to the Defenders,\nthey might be called on to meet claims of damages which they could not possiblyinvestigate or insure.\"\nIn agreeing, as I do, with the judgment of Lord Anderson, I desire to add that I find it hard to\ndissent from the emphatic nature of the language with which his judgment is clothed. I am ofopinion that this Appeal should be dismissed, and I beg to move your Lordships accordingly.\nLord Atkin\nMY LORDS ,\nThe sole question for determination in this case is legal: do the averments made by the pursuer in\nher pleading if true disclose a cause of action? I need not restate the particular facts. The question iswhether the manufacturer of an article of drink sold by him to a distributor in circumstances whichprevent the distributor or the ultimate purchaser or consumer from discovering by inspection anydefect is under any legal duty to the ultimate purchaser or consumer to take reasonable care thatthe article is free from defect likely to cause injury to health. I do not think a more importantproblem has occupied your Lordships in your judicial 'capacity: important both because of itsbearing on public health and because of the practical test which it applies to the system of lawunder which it arises. The case has to be determined in accordance with Scots Law: but it has beena matter of agreement between the experienced counsel who argued this case, and it appears to bethe basis of the judgments of the learned judges of the Court of Session that for the purposes ofdetermining this problem the law of Scotland and of England are the same.

The result is that the courts have been engaged upon anelaborate classification of duties as they exist in respect of property whether real or personal withfurther divisions as to ownership, occupation or control, and distinctions based on the particularrelations of the one side or the other whether manufacturer salesman or landlord, customer, tenant,stranger and so on. In this way it can be ascertained at any time whether the law recognises a duty,but only where the case can be referred to some particular species which has been examined andclassified. And yet the duty which is common to all the cases where liability is established mustlogically be based upon some element common to the cases where it is found to exist. To seek acomplete logical definition of the general principle is probably to go beyond the function of thejudge, for the more general the definition the more likely it is to omit essentials or introducenon-essentials. The attempt was made by Lord Esher in Heaven v. Pender in a definition to which I\nwill later refer. As framed it was demonstrably too wide, t hough it appears to me if properly limited\nto be capable of affording a valuable practical guide.\nAt present I content myself with pointing out that in English law there must be and is some general\nconception of relations, giving rise to a duty of care, of which the particular cases found in thebooks are but instances. The liab ility for negligence whether you style it such or treat it as in other\nsystems as a species of \"culpa,\" is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moralwrongdoing for which the offender must pay. But acts or omissions which any moral code wouldcensure cannot in a practical world be treated so as to give a right to every person injured by themto demand relief. In this way rules of law arise which limit the range of complainants and the extentof their remedy. The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes m law you must not injureyour neighbour; and the lawyer's question \"Who is my neighbour?\" receives a restricted reply. Youmust take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would belikely to injure your neighbour. Who then in law is my neighbour? The answer seems to be personswho are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them incontemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which arecalled in question. This appears to me to be the doctrine of Heaven v. Pender as laid down by Lord\nEsher when it is limited by the notion of proximity intr oduced by Lord Esher himself and A. L.\nSmith L.J. in Le Lievre v. Gould , 1893,1 Q.B. 497. Lord Esher at p. 497 says :\n\"That case established that under certain circumstances one man may owe a duty to\nanother even though there is no contract between them. If one man is near to anotheror is near to the property of another a duty lies upon him not to do that which maycause a personal injury to that other or may injure his property.\"\nSo A. L. Smith L.J.:\n\"The decision of Heaven v. Pender was founded upon the principle that a duty to take\ndue care did arise when the person or property of one was in such proximity to theperson or property of another that if due care was not taken damage might be done bythe one to the other.\"\nI think that this sufficiently states the truth if proximity be not confined to mere physical prox imity;\nbut be used, as I think it was intended, to extend to such close and direct relations that the actcomplained of directly affects a person whom the person alleged to be bound to take care wouldknow would be directly affected by his careless act.

With thisnecessary qualification of proximate relationship as explained in Le Lievre v. Gould , 1893, 1 Q.B.\n491, I think the judgment of Lord Esher expresses the law of England; without the qualification Ithink that the majority of the Court in Heaven v. Pender were justified in thinking the principle as\nexpressed in too general terms. There will no doubt arise cases where it w ill be difficult to\ndetermine whether the contemplated relationship is so close that the duty arises. But in the class ofcase now before the Court I cannot conceive any difficulty to arise. A manufacturer puts up anarticle of food in a container which he knows w ill be opened by the actual consumer. There can be\nno inspection by any purchaser and no reasonable preliminary inspection by the consumer.Negligently in the course of preparation he allows the contents to be mixed with poison. It is saidthat the law of England and Scotland is that the poisoned consumer has no remedy against thenegligent manufacturer. My Lords, if this were the result of the authorities I should consider theresult a grave defect in the law, and so contrary to principle that I should hesitate long beforefollowing any decision to that effect which had not the authority of this House. I would point outthat in the assumed state of the authorities not only would the consumer have no remedy againstthe manufacturer, he would have none against anyone else, for in the circumstances alleged therewould be no evidence of negligence against anyone other than the manufacturer; and except in thecase of a consumer who was also a purchaser no contract and no warranty of fitness and in the caseof the purchase of a specific article under its patent or trade name, which might well be the case inthe purchase of some articles of food or drink, no warranty protecting even the purchaser-consumer. There are other instances than of articles of food and drink where goods are soldintended to be used immediately by the consumer, such as many forms of g oods sold for cleaning\npurposes, when the same liability must exist. The doctrine s upported by the decision below would\nnot only deny a remedy to the consumer who was injured by consuming bottled beer or chocolatespoisoned by the negligence of the manufacturer, but also to the user of what should be a harmlessproprietary medicine, an ointment, a soap, a cleaning fluid or cleaning powder. I confine myself toarticles of common household use, where everyone including the manufacturer knows that thearticles will be used by other persons than the actual ultimate purchaser, viz., by members of hisfamily and his servants, and in some oases his guests. My Lords, I do not think so ill of ourjurisprudence as to suppose that its principles are so remote from the ordinary needs of civ ilised\nsociety and the ordinary claims it makes upon its members as to deny a legal remedy where there isso obviously a social wrong.\nIt will be f ound I think on examination that there is no case in which the circumstances have been\nsuch as I have just suggested where the. liability has been negatived. There are numerous caseswhere the relations were much more remote where the duty has been held riot to exist.

I venture to think that Fry L.J. in Heaven v:Pender 12 Q.B.D. at p. 517 misinterprets Cleasby B.'s judgment in the reference to Langridge v.\nLevy 4 M. & W. 337. Cleasby B. appears to me to make it plain that in his opinion the duty to take\nreasonable care can be substituted for the duty which existed in Langridge v. Levy not to defraud.\nIt is worth noticing that George v. Skivington was referred to by Cleasby B. himself sitting as a\nmember of the Court of Exchequer Chamber in Francis v. Cockrell (L.R. 5 Q.B. at p. 515) and was\nrecognised by him as based on an ordinary duty to take care. It was also affirmed by Lord EsherM.R. in Cunnington v. South Western Railway Co., 1883 49 L.T. 392, decided on July 2nd at a datebetween the argument and the judgment in Heaven v. Pender , though as in that case the Court\nnegatived any breach of duty the expression of opinion is not authoritative. The existence of theduty contended for is also supported by Hawkins v. Greville (1896) 12 T.L.R. 532, where a dock\nlabourer in the employ of the Dock Co. was injured by a defective sack which had been hired bythe consignees from the defendant who knew the use to which it was to be put, and had beenprovided by the consignees for the use of the Dock Company, who had been employed by them tounload the ship on the Dock Company's premises. The Divisional Court, Day and Lawrence J.J.,held the defendant liable for negligence. Similarly in Elliott v. Hall (1885) 15 Q.B.D. 315 the\ndefendants, colliery owners, consigned coal to the plaintiff's employers, coal merchants, in a truckhired by the defendants from a wagon company. The plaintiff was injured in the course of unloadingthe coal by reason of the defective condition of the truck and was held by a Divisional Court,Grove and A. L. Smith J.J., entitled to recover on the ground of the defendant's breach of duty tosee that the truck was not in a dangerous condition. It is to be noticed that in neither case was thedefective chattel in the defendant's occupation, possession or control or on their premises, while inthe latter case it was not even their property. It is sometimes said that the liability in these casesdepends upon an invitation by the defendant to the plaintiff to use his chattel. I do not find thedecisions expressed to be based upon this ground but rather upon the knowledge that the plaintiff inthe course of the contemplated use of the chattel would use it: and the supposed invitation appearsto me to be in many cases a fiction and merely a form of expressing the direct relation betweensupplier and user which gives rise to the duty to take care. A very recent case which has theauthority of this House is Chapman v. Sadler & Co. . , 1929 A.C. 584. In that case a firm of\nstevedores employed to unload a cargo of maize in bags provided the rope slings by which the cargowas raised to the ship's deck by their own men using the ship's tackle, and then transported to thedockside by the shore porters of whom the plaintiff was one. The porters relied on examination bythe stevedores and had themselves no opportunity of examination In these circumstances thisHouse reversing the decision of the First Division held that there was a duty owed by the stevedorecompany to the porters to see that the slings were fit for use and restored the judgment of the LordOrdinary, Lord Morison, in favour of the pursuer.

Chester and Holyhead Railway\n(1848) 2 Ex. 251. That was an action on the case in which it was alleged that the defendants hadconstructed a bridge over the Dee on their railway and had licensed the use of the bridge to theShrewsbury and Chester Railway to carry passengers over it, and had so negligently constructed thebridge that the plaintiff, a passenger of the last named railway, had been injured by the falling of thebridge. At the trial before V aughan Williams J. the judge had directed the jury that the plaintiff wasentitled to recover if the bridge was not constructed with reasonable care and skill. On a motion fora new trial the Attorney-General, Sir John Jervis, contended that there was misdirection, for thedefendants were only liable for negligence and the jury might have understood that there was anabsolute liability. The Court of Exchequer, after consulting the trial judge as to his direction,refused the rule. This case is said by Kelly C.B. in Francis v. Cockrell in the Exchequer Chamber\n(1870) L.R. 5 Q.B. at p. 505 to have been decided upon an implied contract with every personlawfully using the bridge that it was reasonably fit for the purpose. I can find no trace of such aground in the pleading or in the argument or judgment. It is true that the defendants were theowners and occupiers of the bridge. The law as to the liability to invitees and licensees had not thenbeen developed. The case is interesting because it is a simple action on the case for negligence, andthe Court upheld the duty to persons using the bridge to take reasonable care that the bridge wassafe.Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] UKHL 100 (26 May 1932) http ://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1932/100.html\n10 of 25 5/2/2012 4:51 P M", "start_char_idx": 3345, "end_char_idx": 5835, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80d94086-2345-4a18-a9e0-2ff4e615c9b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "80d94086-2345-4a18-a9e0-2ff4e615c9b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_path": "data\\Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 173032, "creation_date": "2024-02-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-07", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cc17b7c7-ccc2-4d21-a49f-d26b0303b8d3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_path": "data\\Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 173032, "creation_date": "2024-02-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-07", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-07"}, "hash": "0ab07d322c03a5a599285ff6b8e7b4ea86c11b30cfb76f01607393c702f99b6f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1a917469-4104-4374-9d9f-2fd909c08d80", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_path": "data\\Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 173032, "creation_date": "2024-02-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-07", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-07"}, "hash": "f9bf211fc2361e57db6949128d410d4181edadb074833f55a33f59034ba0e5b5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "419de70c-183d-4daf-9404-99473df1885e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ad4fd79eac292d10c55a83602dfd5f5a3eef17d5ce06ad4235061aaab5b4461a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It now becomes necessary to consider the cases which have been referred to in the Courts below as\nlaying down the proposition that no duty to take care is owed to the consumer in such a case as this.\nIn Dixon v. Bell , 1816 5 M. & S. 198, the defendant had left a loaded gun at his lodgings and sent\nhis servant, a mulatto girl aged about 13 or 14, for the gun, asking the landlord to remove thepriming and give it her. The landlord did remove the priming and gave it to the girl, who laterlevelled it at the plaintiff's small son, drew the trigger and injured the boy. The action was in casefor negligently entrusting the young servant with the gun. The jury at the trial before LordEllenborough had returned a verdict for the plaintiff. A motion by Sir W illiam Garrow, Attorney-\nGeneral, for a new trial was dismissed by the Court. Lord Ellenborough and Bayley J.J., the formerremarking that it was incumbent on the defendant, who by charging the gun had made it capable ofdoing mischief, to render it safe and innoxious.\nIn, Langridge v. Levy (1837) 2 M. & W. 519 (1838) 4 M. & W. 337 the action was in case and the\ndeclaration alleged that the defendant by falsely and fraudulently warranting a gun to have beenmade by Nock and to be a good, safe and secure gun, sold the gun to the plaintiff's father for theuse of himself and his son, and that one of his sons confiding in the warranty used the gun, whichburst and injured him. Plea not guilty and no warranty as alleged. The report is not verysatisfactory. No evidence is reported of any warranty or statement except that the gun was anelegant twist gun by Nock. The judge left to the jury whether the defendant had warranted the gunto be by Nock and to be safe: whether it was in fact unsafe: and whether the defendant warranted itto be safe knowing that it was not so. The jury returned a general verdict for the plaintiff. It appearsto have been argued that the plaintiff could recover wherever there is a breach of duty imposed onthe defendant by contract or otherwise, and the plaintiff is injured by reason of its breach: by this ismeant apparently that the duty need not be owed to the plaintiff but that he can take advantage ofthe breach of a duty owed to a third party. This contention was negatived by the Court, who held,however, that the plaintiff could recover if a representation known to be false was made to a thirdperson with the intention that a chattel should be used by the plaintiff, even though it does notappear that the defendant intended the false representation to be communicated to him. See perParke B. 2 M. & W. at p. 531. The same view was adopted by the Exchequer Chamber, the user bythe plaintiff being treated by the Court as one of the acts contemplated by the fraudulent defendant.It is unnecessary to consider whether the proposition can be supported in its widest form. It issufficient to say that the case was based as I think in the pleading and certainly in the judgment onthe ground of fraud, and it appears to add nothing of value positively or negatively to the presentdiscussion.

The\nplaintiff had demurred to two of the pleas as to which there was no decision by the Court, but onthe hearing of the plaintiff's demurrer the Court in accordance with the practice of the day wereentitled to consider the whole record including the declaration, and coming to the conclusion thatthe declaration disclosed no cause of action, gave judgment for the defendant - See Sutton's\"Personal Actions at Common Law\" page 113. The advantage of the procedure is that we are in aposition to know the precise issue at law which arose for determination. The declaration was in caseand alleged that the defendant had contracted with the Postmaster-General to provide the mailcoach to convey mails from Hartford to Holyhead and to keep the mails in safe condition, thatAtkinson and others with notice of the said contract bad contracted with the Postmaster-General toconvey the road mailcoach from Hartford to Holyhead : and that the plaintiff relying on the saidfirst contract hired himself to Atkinson to drive the mailcoach, but that the defendant so negligentlyconducted himself and so utterly disregarded his aforesaid contract that the defendant having themeans of knowing and well knowing all the aforesaid premises, the mailcoach being in a dangerouscondition owing to certain latent defects and to no other cause gave way, whereby the plaintiff wasthrown from his seat and injured. It is to be observed that no negligence apart from breach ofcontract was alleged, in other words no duty was alleged other than the duty arising out of thecontract : it is not stated that the defendant knew or ought to have known of the latent defect. Theargument of the defendant was that on the face of the declaration the wrong arose merely out of thebreach of a contract, and that only a party to the contract could sue. The Court of Exchequeradopted that view, as clearly appears from the judgments of Alderson and Rolfe B.B. There aredicta by Lord Abinger which are too wide as to an action of negligence being confined to cases ofbreach of a public duty. The actual decision appears to have been manifestly right; no duty to theplaintiff arose out of the contract; and the duty of the defendant under the contract with thePostmaster General to put the coach in good repair could not have involved those direct relationswith the servant of the persons whom the Postmaster-General employed to drive the coach aswould give rise to a duty of care owed to such servant.

In that\ncase the declaration in case alleged that the plaintiff, Frederick Langmeid, had bought from thedefendant, the maker and seller of \" the Holliday lamp,\" a lamp to be used by himself and his wifeEliza in the plaintiff's shop; that the defendant induced the sale by the false and fraudulent warrantythat the lamp was reasonably fit for the purpose; and that the plaintiff Eliza, confiding in the saidwarranty, lighted the lamp which exploded whereby she was injured. It is perhaps not anextravagant guess to suppose that the plaintiffs pleader had read the case of Langridge v. Levy .\nThe jury found all the facts for the plaintiffs except the allegation of fraud; they were not satisfiedthat the defendant knew of the defects. The plaintiff Frederick had already recovered damages onthe contract of sale for breach of the implied warranty of fitness. The declaration made noaverment of negligence. V erdict was entered at the trial by Baron Martin for the plaintiff but withliberty to the defendant to move to enter the verdict for him. A rule having been obtained plaintiff'scounsel sought to support the verdict on the ground that this was not an action for a breach of dutyarising solely from contract but for an injury resulting from conduct amounting to fraud. BaronParke, who delivered the judgment of the Court, held that fraud having been negatived the actioncould not be maintained on that ground. He then went on to discuss cases in which a third personnot a party to a contract may sue for damages sustained if it is broken. After dealing with thenegligence of a surgeon or of a carrier, or of a firm in breach of contract committing a nuisance on ahighway, he deals with the case where anyone delivers to another without notice an instrument inits nature dangerous or under particular circumstances', as a loaded gun, and refers to Dixon v. Bell\n, though what this case has to do with contract it is difficult to see. He then goes on:\n\"But it would be going much too far to say that so much care is required in the ordinary\nintercourse of life between one individual and another that if a machine not in itsnature dangerous, a carriage for instance, but which might become so by a latent defectentirely unknown although discoverable by the exercise of ordinary care should be lentor given by one person, even by the person who manufactured it, to another, theformer should be answerable to the latter for a subsequent damage accruing by the useof it.\"\nIt is worth noticing how guarded this dictum is. The case put is a machine such as a carriage not in\nits nature dangerous which might become dangerous by a latent defect entirely unknown. Thenthere is the saving although discoverable by \"the exercise of ordinary care,\" discoverable by whomis not said; it may include the person to whom the innocent machine is \"lent or given\". Then thedictum is confined to machines \"lent or given\" (a later sentence makes it clear that a distinction isintended between these words and delivered to the purchaser under the contract of sale), and themanufacturer is introduced for the first time even by the person who manufactured it. I do not for amoment believe that Baron Parke had in his mind such a case as a loaf negligently mixed withpoison by the baker which poisoned a purchaser's family. He is in my opinion confining his remarksprimarily to cases where a person is seeking to rely upon a duty of care which arises out of acontract with a third party; and has never even discussed the case of a manufacturer negligentlycausing an article to be dangerous and selling it in that c ondition whether with immediate or\nmediate effect upon the consumer. It is noteworthy that he only refers to \"letting or giving\" chattels,operations known to the law where the special relations thereby created have a particular bearingon the existence or non-existence of a duty to take care.

Lubbock , 1905, 1 K.B. 253. The plaintiff sued in\nthe County Court for personal injuries due to the negligence of the defendant. The plaintiff was adriver in the employ of a firm who owned vans. The defendant, a master wheelwright, hadcontracted with the firm to keep their vans in good and substantial repair. The allegation ofnegligence was that the defendant's servant had negligently failed to inspect and repair a defectivewheel, and had negligently repaired the wheel. The learned County Court judge had held that theDefendant owed no duty to the Plaintiff, and the Divisional Court, Lord Alverstone, L.C.J., Willsand Kennedy, J.J., and the Court of Appeal agreed with him. The Master of the Rolls, Sir R. HennCollins, said that the case was concluded by Winterbottom v. Wright , 10 M. & W. 109. In other\nwords he must have treated the duty as alleged to arise only from a breach of contract; for as hasbeen pointed , out that was the only allegation in Winterbottom v. Wright , negligence apart from\ncontract being neither averred nor proved. It is true that he cites with approval the dicta of LordAbinger in that case: but obviously I think his approval must be limited to those dicta so far as they\nrelated to the particular facts before the Court of Appeal: and to cases where as Lord Abinger saysthe law, permits a contract to be turned into a tort.

Pender that any one\nwho without due warning supplies to others for use an instrument which to his knowledge is in sucha condition as to cause danger is liable for injury. I venture to think that the Lord Justice ismistakenly treating a proposition which applies one test of a duty as though it afforded the onlycriterion.\nMathew, L.J., appears to me to put the case on its proper footing when he says at p. 259 the\nargument of the Plaintiff was that the Defendant's servants had been negligent in the performanceof the contract with the owners of the van and that it followed as a matter of law that any one inthis employment had a cause of action against the Defendant. \" It is impossible to accept such awide proposition and indeed it is difficult to see how if it were the law trade could be carried on.\" Ientirely agree. I have no doubt that in that case the Plaintiff failed to show that the repairer owedany duty to him. The question of law in that case seems very different to that raised in the presentcase. The case of Blacker v. Lake & Elliot Ltd. 1912 (104 L.T. 533) approaches more nearly the\nfacts of this case. I have read and re-read it having unfeigned respect for the authority of the twolearned judges, Hamilton and Lush, J.J., who decided it: and I am bound to say I have found\ndifficulty in formulating the precise grounds upon which the judgment was given. The Plaintiff hadbeen injured by the bursting of a brazing lamp which he had bought from a shopkeeper who hadbought it from the manufacturer, the Defendant. The Plaintiff had used the lamp for 12 monthsbefore the accident. The case was tried in the County Court before that excellent lawyer, the lateJudge Sir Rowland Roberts. That learned judge had directed the jury that the Plaintiff couldsucceed if the Defendants had put upon the market a lamp not fit for use in the sense that a personworking it with reasonable care would incur a risk which a properly constructed lamp would notimpose upon him. The jury found that the lamp was defective by reason of an improper system ofmaking an essential joint between the container and the vaporiser; that the Defendants did notknow that it was dangerous but ought as reasonable men to have known it. Ha milton J. seems to\nhave thought that there was no evidence of negligence in this respect. Lush J. expressly says so andimplies \"I also think\" that Hamilton J. so t hought. If so the case resolves itself into a series of\nimportant dicta. Hamilton J. says at p. 536 that it has been decided in authorities from\nWinterbottom v. Wright to Earl v. Lubbock that the breach of the Defendants' contract with A, to\nuse care and skill in and a bout the manufacture or repair of an article does not itself give any cause\nof action to B when injured by the article proving to be defective in breach of that contract. Hethen goes on to say how is the case of the Plaintiffs any better when there is no contract proved ofwhich there could be a breach. I think with respect that this saying does not give sufficient weightto the actual issues raised by the pleadings on which alone the older cases are an authority. If theissue raised was an alleged duty created by contract it would have been irrelevant to consider dutiescreated without reference to contract: and contract cases cease to be authorities for duties allegedto exist beyond or without contract. Moreover it is a mistake to describe the authorities as dealingwith the breach of care or skill in the manufacture of g oods, as contrasted with repair. The only\nmanufacturing case was Langmeid v. Hollidayd where negligence was not alleged. Hamilton J.\nrecognises that George v.

Horridge, J., found that a bottle of ginger beer was not dangerous in itself, but\nthat this defective bottle was in fact dangerous; but as the Defendants did not know that it wasdangerous they were not liable though by the exercise of reasonable care they could havediscovered the defect. This case differs from the present only by reason of the fact that it was notthe manufacturers of the ginger beer who caused the defect in the bottle : but on the assumptionthat the jury were right in finding a lack of reasonable care in not examining the bottle, I shouldhave come to the conclusion that as the manufacturers must have contemplated the bottle beinghandled immediately by the consumer they owed a duty to him to take care that he s hould not be\ninjured externally by explosion just as I think they owed a duty to him to take care that he shouldnot be injured internally by poison or other noxious thing. My Lords, I do not find it necessary todiscuss at length the cases dealing with duties where a thing is dangerous, or in the narrowercategory belongs to a class of things which are dangerous in themselves. I regard the distinction asan unnatural one so far as it is used to serve as a logical differentiation by which to distinguish theexistence or non-existence of a legal right. In this respect I agree with what was said by Scrutton, L.J., in Hope & Son v. Anglo American Oil Co. (1922), 12 Lloyds List 183 at p. 187, a case whichwas ultimately decided on a question of fact:\n\"Personally I do not understand the difference between a thing dangerous in itself as\npoison, and a thing not dangerous as a class but by negligent construction dangerous asa particular thing. The latter if anything seems the more dangerous of the two : it is awolf in sheep's clothing instead of an obvious wolf.\"\nThe nature of the thing may very well call for different degrees of care, and the person dealing with\nit may well contemplate persons as being within the sphere of his duty to take care who would notbe sufficiently proximate with less dangerous goods; so that not only the degree of care but therange of persons to whom a duty is owed may be extended. But they all illustrate the generalprinciple. In the Dominion Natural Gas Co., Ltd. v. Co llins & Perkins \n1909 A.C. 640  the Appellants\nhad installed a gas apparatus and were supplying natural gas on the premises of a railway company.They had installed a regulator to control the pressure and their men negligently made an escapevalve discharge into the building instead of into the open air. The railway workmen\u2014the plaintiffs\u2014were injured by an explosion in the premises. The defendants were held liable. Lord Dunedin ingiving the judgment of the Judicial Committee consisting of himself, Lord Macnaghten, LordCollins and Sir Arthur Wils on, after stating that there was no relation of contract between the\nplaintiffs and the defendants, proceeded:\n\"There may be, however, in the case of anyone performing an operation or setting up\nand installing a machine a relationship of duty. What that duty is will vary according tothe subject matter of the things involved. It has, however, again and again been heldthat in the case of articles dangerous in themselves, such as loaded firearms, poisons,explosives and other things ejusdem generis there is a particular duty to take\nprecaution imposed upon those who send forth or instal such articles where it isnecessarily the case that other parties will come within their proximity.\"\nThis with respect exactly sums up the position. The duty may exist independently of contract.\nWhether it exists or not depends upon the subject matter involved, but clearly in the class of thingsenumerated there is a special duty to take precautions. This is the very opposite of creating aspecial category in which alone the duty exists. I may add, though it obviously would make no\"difference in the creation, of a duty, that the installation of an apparatus to be used for gas perhapsmore closely resembles the manufacture of a gun than a dealing with a loaded gun. In both casesthe actual work is innocuous: it is only when the gun is loaded or the apparatus charged with gasthat the danger arises. My Lords, I do not think it necessary to consider the obligation of a personwho entrusts to a carrier goods which are dangerous or which he ought to know are dangerous. Asfar as the direct obligation of the consignor to the carrier is concerned, it has been put upon animplied warranty ( Brass v.

It was held that the first railway company were under no duty to the\ninjured workman to examine the wagon for defects at the end of their contractual haulage. Therewas ample opportunity for inspection by the second railway company. The relations were notproximate. In the second Cavalier v. Pope \n(1906 A.C. 428 ) the wife of the tenant of a house let\nunfurnished sought to recover from the landlord damages for personal injuries arising from thenon-repair of the house on the ground that the landlord had contracted with her husband to repairthe house. It was held that the wife was not a party to the contract: and that the well-knownabsence of any duty in respect of the letting an unfurnished house prevented her from relying onany cause of action for negligence.\nIn the most recent case Bottomley v. Bannister (1932) 101 L. J. K.B. 46 an action under Lord\nCampbell's Act the deceased man the father of the plaintiff had taken an unfurnished house fromthe defendants who had installed a gas boiler with a special gas burner which if properly regulatedrequired no flue. The deceased and his wife were killed by fumes from the apparatus. The case wasdetermined on the ground that the apparatus was part of the realty and that the landlord did notknow of the danger : but there is a discussion of the case on the supposition that it was a chattel.Greer L.J. at p. 54 states with truth that it is not easy to reconcile all the authorities: and that thereis no authority binding on the Court of Appeal that a person selling an article which he did notknow to be dangerous can be held liable to a person with whom he has made no contract by reasonof the fact that reasonable inquiries might have enabled him to discover that the article was in factdangerous. When the danger is in fact occasioned by his own lack of care then in cases of aproximate relationship this case will I trust s upply the deficiency.\nIt is always a satisfaction to an English lawyer to be able to test his application of fundamental\nprinciples of the common law by the development of the same doctrines by the lawyers of theCourts of the United States. In that country I find that the law appears to be well established in thesense in which I have indicated. The mouse had emerged from the ginger beer bottle in the U.S.before it appeared in Scotland but there it brought a liability upon the manufacturer. I must not in\nthis long judgment do more than refer to the illuminating judgment of Cardozo J. in McPherson v.\nBuick Motor Co. in the New York Court of Appeals (1916) 217 N.Y . 382 in which he states the\nprinciples of the law as I should desire to state them and reviews the authorities in other States thanhis own. Whether the principle he affirms would apply to the particular facts of that case in thiscountry would be a question for consideration if the case arose. It might be that the course ofbusiness by giving opportunities of examination to the immediate purchaser or otherwise prevented\nthe relation between manufacturer and the user of the car being so close as to create a duty. But theAmerican decision would undoubtedly lead to a decision in favour of the pursuer in the presentcase.\nMy Lords if your Lordships accept the view that this pleading discloses a relevant cause of action\nyou w ill be affirming the pr oposition that by Scots and English law alike a manufacturer of products\nwhich he sells in such a form as to show that he intends them to reach the ultimate consumer in theform in which they left him with no reasonable possibility of intermediate examinati on, and with\nthe knowledge that the absence of reasonable care in the preparation or putting up of the productsis likely to result in injury to the consumers life or property owes a duty to the consumer to takethat reasonable care. It is a proposition that I venture to say no one in Scotland or England who wasnot a lawyer would for one moment doubt.

It is only a factor which may render it easier to bring negligence home to the manufacturer.\nSecondly I desire to say that in my opinion the decision in Winterbottom v. Wright , 10 M. & W.\n109, is directly in point against the appellant.\nThe examination of the report makes it, I think, plain (1) that negligence was alleged and was the\nbasis of the claim, and (2) that the wide proposition which I have indicated was that for which theplaintiff was contending.\nThe declaration averred ( inter alia ) that the defendant \"so improperly and negligently conducted\nhimself\" that the accident complained of happened.\nThe plaintiff's counsel said, \"here the declaration alleges the accident to have happened through the\ndefendant's negligence and want of care.\"\nThe alarming consequences of accepting the validity of this proposition were pointed out by the\ndefendant's counsel, who said, \"For example, every one of the sufferers by such an accident as thatwhich recently happened on the V ersailles Railway might have his action against the manufacturerof the defective axle.\"\nThat the action which was in case embraced a cause of action in tort is I think implicit in its form\nand appears from the concluding sentence of Lord Abinger's judgment, which was in these terms:\n\"By permitting this action we should be working this injustice, that after the defendant\nhad done everything to the satisfaction of his employer and after all matters betweenthem had been adjusted and all accounts settled on the footing of their contract, weshould subject them to be ripped open by this action of tort being brought against him.\"\nI will only add to what has been already said by my noble and learned friend Lord Buckmaster with\nregard to the decisions and dicta relied upon by the appellant, and the other relevant reported casesthat I am unable to explain how the cases of dangerous articles can have been treated as\"exceptions\" if the appellant's contention is well founded. Upon the view which I take of the matterthe reported cases, some directly, others impliedly, negative the existence as part of the CommonLaw of England of any principle affording support to the appellant's claim, and therefore there is inmy opinion no material from which it is legitimate for your Lordships' House to deduce such aprinciple.\nLord Thankerton\nMY LORDS ,\nIn this action the Appellant claims reparation from the Respondent in respect of illness and other\ninjurious effects resulting from the presence of a decomposed snail in a bottle of ginger beer,alleged to have been manufactured by the Respondent, and which was partially consumed by her, ithaving been ordered by a friend on her behalf in a cafe in Paisley.\nThe action is based on negligence, and the only question in this appeal is whether, taking the\nAppellant's averments pro veritate , they disclose a case relevant in law, so as to entitle her to have\nthem remitted for proof. The Lord Ordinary allowed a proof, but, on a reclaiming note for theRespondent, the Second Division of the Court of Session recalled the Lord Ordinary's interlocutorand dismissed the action, following their decision in the recent cases of Mullen v.

It is not at all necessary that there should be any direct contract between them, becausethe action is not based upon contract, but upon negligence; but it is necessary for the pursuer insuch an action to show there was a duty owed to her by the defender, because a man cannot becharged with negligence if he has no obligation to exercise diligence \u2014 Kemp & Dougall v\nDarngavil Coal Co. , 1909 S.C. 1314, per Lord Kinnear at p. 1319; See also Clelland v. Robb ,\n1911 S.C. 253, per Lord President Dunedin and Lord Kinnear at p. 256. The question in each caseis whether the pursuer has established, or, in the stage of the present appeal, has relevantly averred,such facts as involve the existence of such a relation of duty.\nWe are not dealing here with a case of what is called an article per se dangerous or one which was\nknown by the defender to be dangerous, in which cases a special duty of protection or adequatewarning is placed upon the person who uses or distributes it. The present case is that of amanufacturer and a consumer, with whom he has no contractual relation, of an article which themanufacturer did not know to be dangerous, and, unless the consumer can establish a specialrelationship with the manufacturer, it is clear, in my opinion, that, neither the Law of Scotland northe Law of England, w ill hold that the manufacturer has any duty towards the consumer to exercise\ndiligence. In such a case the remedy of the consumer, if any, will lie against the intervening partyfrom whom he has procured the article. I am aware that the American Courts, in the decisionsreferred to by my noble and learned friend Lord Mac millan, have taken a view more fa vourable to\nthe consumer.\nThe special circumstances, from which the Appellant claims that such a relationship of duty should\nbe inferred, may, I think, be stated thus, viz. that the Respondent, in placing his manufacturedarticle of drink upon the market, has intentionally so excluded interference with, or examination of,the article by any intermediate handler of the goods between himself and the consumer, that he has,of his own accord, brought himself into direct relationship with the consumer, with the result thatthe consumer is entitled to rely upon the exercise of d iligence by the manufacturer to secure that\nthe article shall not be harmful to the consumer. If that contention be sound, the consumer, on hershowing that the article has reached her intact, and that she has been injured by the harmful natureof the article owing to the failure of the manufacturer to take reasonable care in its preparationprior to its enclosure in the sealed vessel, will be entitled to reparation from the manufacturer.\nIn my opinion the existence of a legal duty under such circumstances is in conformity with the\nprinciples of both the Law of Scotland and of the Law of England.

I have had the privilege of considering the discussion of\nthese authorities by my noble and learned friend Lord Atkin in the judgment which he has justdelivered, and I so entirely agree with it that I cannot usefully add anything to it.\nAn interesting illustration of similar circumstances is to be f ound in Gordon v. McHardy , (1903) 6\nF. 210, in which the pursuer sought to recover damages from a retail grocer on account of the deathof his son by ptomaine poisoning, caused by eating tinned salmon purchased from the defender. Thepursuer averred that the tin, when sold, was dented, but he did not suggest that the grocer had cutthrough the metal and allowed air to get in, or had otherwise caused injury to the contents. Theaction was held irrelevant, the Lord Justice Clerk remarking, \"I do not see how the defender couldhave examined the tin of salmon which he is alleged to have sold without destroying the verycondition which the manufacturer had established in order to preserve the contents, the tin notbeing intended to be opened until immediately before use.\" Apparently in that case themanufacturers' label was off the tin when sold, and they had not been identified. I should be sorryto think that the meticulous care of the manufacturer to exclude interference or inspection by thegrocer in that case should relieve the grocer of any responsib ility to the consumer wit hout any\ncorresponding assumption of duty by the manufacturer.\nMy Lords, I am of opinion that the contention of the Appellant is sound and that she has relevantly\naverred a relationship of duty as between the Respondent and herself, as also that her averments ofthe Respondent's neglect of that duty are relevant.\nThe cases of Mullen and McGowan which the learned Judges of the Second Division followed in\nthe present case related to facts similar in every respect except that the foreign matter was adecomposed mouse. In these cases the same Court\u2014Lord Hunter dissenting\u2014held that themanufacturer owed no duty to the consumer. The view of the majority was that the Englishauthorities excluded the existence of such a duty, but Lord Ormidale (at p. 471) would otherwisehave been prepared to come to a contrary conclusion. Lord Hunter's opinion seems to be inconformity with the view I have expressed above.\nMy conclusion rests upon the facts averred in this case, and would apparently also have applied in\nthe cases of Mullen and McGowan , in which, however, there had been a proof before answer, and\nthere was also a question as to whether the pursuers had proved their averments.\nI am therefore of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the case should be remitted for\nproof, as the pursuer did not ask for an issue.\nLord Macmillan\nMY LORDS ,\nThe incident which in its legal bearings your Lordships are called upon to consider in this appeal\nwas in itself of a trivial character, though the consequences to the appellant, as she describes them,were serious enough. It appears from the appellant's allegations that on an evening in August, 1928,she and a friend visited a cafe\" in Paisley, where her friend ordered for her some ice cream and abottle of ginger beer. These were supplied by the Shopkeeper, who opened the ginger beer bottleand poured some of the contents over the ice cream which was contained in a tumbler. Theappellant drank part of the mixture and her friend then proceeded to pour the remaining contents ofthe bottle into the tumbler. As she was doing so a decomposed snail floated out with the gingerbeer. In consequence of her having drunk part of the contaminated contents of the bottle theappellant alleges that she contracted a serious illness. The bottle is stated to (have been of darkopaque glass, so that the condition of the contents could not be ascertained by inspection, and tohave been closed with a metal cap, while on the side was a label bearing the name of therespondent, who was the manufacturer of the ginger beer of which the shopkeeper was merely theretailer.\nThe allegations of negligence on which the appellant founds her action against the respondent may\nbe shortly summarised. She says that the ginger beer was manufactured by the respondent for saleas an article of drink to members of the public, including herself; that the presence of adecomposing snail in ginger beer renders the ginger beer harmful and dangerous to those consumingit; and that it was the duty of the respondent to exercise his process of manufacture with sufficientcare to prevent snails getting into or remaining in the bottles which he filled with ginger beer.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4618, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "310cc728-de68-4ce0-b9f0-ef21b09f94f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "310cc728-de68-4ce0-b9f0-ef21b09f94f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_path": "data\\Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 173032, "creation_date": "2024-02-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-07", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "57ff0f07-2e62-4f1f-81e6-45e9aae1a967", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_path": "data\\Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 173032, "creation_date": "2024-02-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-07", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-07"}, "hash": "886b8743e0dec85aa2761b342a0e21fee682a3955b6763603306478fabcf4a52", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "de5ec821-b55f-41c2-841f-abef59926fc7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_path": "data\\Donoghue_v_Stevenson__1932__UKHL_100__26_May_1932_.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 173032, "creation_date": "2024-02-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-07", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-07"}, "hash": "43b1687c364207b1873ba9b5a25b71df38d2e7745b408993f80221efb436cea6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "48392a64-d9fd-415f-92d8-98d4e877472f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "15949017dc5170d7c818a40e6076d29c6c6893c9320e6f08914286abeaa3ad05", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The bottle is stated to (have been of darkopaque glass, so that the condition of the contents could not be ascertained by inspection, and tohave been closed with a metal cap, while on the side was a label bearing the name of therespondent, who was the manufacturer of the ginger beer of which the shopkeeper was merely theretailer.\nThe allegations of negligence on which the appellant founds her action against the respondent may\nbe shortly summarised.

Barr & Co. and McGowan v. Barr & Co. , \n1929\nS.C. 461 . The only difference in fact between those cases and the present case is that it was a\nmouse and not a snail which was found in the ginger beer. The present appeal is consequently ineffect against the decision in these previous cases, which I now proceed to examine.\nThe two cases, being to all intents and purposes identical, were heard and decided together. In\nMullen v. Barr & Co. the Sheriff-Substitute allowed a proof, but the Sheriff on appeal dismissed the\naction as irrelevant. In McGowan v. Barr & Co. the Sheriff-Substitute allowed a proof and the\nSheriff altered his interlocutor by allowing a proof before answer, that is to say, a proof underreservation of all objections to the relevancy of the action. On the cases coming before the SecondDivision on the appeals of the pursuer and the defenders respectively their Lordships ordered aproof before answer in each case arid the evidence was taken before Lord Hunter. It will besufficient to refer to ullen's case in which their Lordships gave their reasons for assoilzieing the\ndefenders in both cases. The Lord Justice-Clerk held that negligence had not been proved andtherefore did not pronounce upon the question of relevancy. Lord Ormidale held that there was norelevant case against the defenders, but would have been prepared if necessary to hold that in anycase negligence had not been established by the evidence. Lord Hunter held that the case wasrelevant and that negligence had been proved. Lord Anderson held that the pursuer had no case inlaw against the defenders, but that if this view was erroneous, negligence had not been proved.\nI desire to draw special attention to certain passages in the opinions of their Lordships. At p. 470\nthe learned Lord Justice Clerk states that he prefers \" to base his judgment on the proposition thatthe pursuer has failed to prove fault on the part of the defenders\" and feels \" absolved fromexpressing a concluded opinion on the thorny and difficult question of law whether, assuming faultto be proved on the part of the defenders, the pursuer has in law a right to sue them.\" In the presentcase his Lordship, after pointing out that he had formally reserved his opinion on the point inMullen v. Barr & Co. proceeds :\u2014\n\"I think I indicated not obscurely the view which I entertained on a perusal of the\nEnglish cases,\"\nand to that view, in deference to the English cases which his Lordship has reconsidered, he has\ngiven effect adversely to the present appellant.

Wright .\" In view of the deference thus paid to\nEnglish precedents it is a singular fact that the case of Winterbottom v. Wright is one in which no\nnegligence in the sense of breach of a duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff was alleged onthe part of the defendant. The truth, as I hope to show, is that there is in the English reports no such\"unbroken and consistent current of decisions\" as would justify the aspersion that the law ofEngland has committed itself irrevocably to what is neither reasonable nor equitable, or require aScottish judge in following them to do violence to his conscience. \"In my opinion,\" said Lord Esherin Emmens v. Pottle, 1885, 16 Q.B.D., 354 at pp. 357-8, \"any proposition the result of which wouldbe to show that the common law of England is wholly unreasonable and unjust cannot be part ofthe common law of England.\"\nAt your Lordships' bar Counsel for both parties to the present appeal, accepting, as I do also, the\nview that there is no distinction between the law of Scotland and the law of England in the legalprinciples applicable to the case, confined their arguments to the English authorities. The appellantendeavoured to establish that according to the law of England the pleadings disclose a good causeof action; the respondent endeavoured to show that on the English decisions the appellant hadstated no admissible case. I propose therefore to address myself at once to an examination of therelevant English precedents.\nI observe in the first place that there is no decision of this House upon the point at issue, for I agree\nwith Lord Hunter that such cases as Cavalier v. Pope \n[1906] A.C. 428  and Cameron v. Young\n[1909] A.C. 640  which decided that \"a stranger to a lease cannot found upon a landlord's failure to\nfulfil obligations undertaken by him under contract with his lessee\" are in a different chapter of thelaw. Nor can it by any means be said that the cases present \"an unbroken and consistent current\" ofauthority for some flow one way and some the other.\nIt humbly appears to me that the diversity of view which is exhibited in such cases as George v.\nSkivington , 1869, L.R. 5 Ex. 1 on the one hand and Blacker v. Lake & Elliot , 1912, 106 L.T. 533,\non the other hand\u2014to take two extreme instances\u2014is explained by the fact that in the discussionof the topic which now engages your Lordships' attention two rival principles of the law find ameeting place where each has contended for supremacy. On the one hand there is thewell-established principle that no one other than a party to a contract can complain of a breach ofthat contract. On the other hand there is the equally well-established doctrine that negligence apartfrom contract gives a right of action to the party injured by that negligence\u2014and here I use theterm negligence of course in its technical legal sense, implying a duty owed and neglected. The factthat there is a contractual relationship between the parties which may give rise to an action forbreach of contract does not exclude the co-existence of a right of action founded on negligence asbetween the same parties independently of the contract though arising out of the relationship in factbrought about by the contract. Of this the best illustration is the right of the injured railway\npassenger to sue the railway company either for breach of the contract of safe carriage or fornegligence in carrying him. And there is no reason why the same set of facts should not give oneperson a right of action in contract and another person a right of action in tort.

Not in contract, for there was no contract between these parties; not in tort,for no bad faith or negligence on the defendant's part was proved.\"\nWhere, as in cases like the present, so much depends upon the avenue of approach to the question\nit is very easy to take the wrong turning. If you begin with the sale by the manufacturer to the retaildealer, then the consumer who purchases from the retailer is at once seen to be a stranger to thecontract between the retailer and the manufacturer and so disentitled to sue upon it. There is nocontractual relation between manufacturer and the consumer and thus the plaintiff if he is tosucceed is driven to try to bring himself within one or other of the exceptional cases where thestrictness of the rule that none but a party to a contract can found on a breach of that contract hasbeen mitigated in the public interest as it has been in the case of a person who issues a chattelwhich is inherently dangerous or which he knows to be in a dangerous condition. If on the otherhand you disregard the fact that the circumstances of the case at one stage include the existence ofa contract of sale between the manufacturer and the retailer and approach the question by askingwhether there is evidence of carelessness on the part of the manufacturer and whether he owed aduty to be careful in a question with the party who has been injured in consequence of his want ofcare, the circumstance that the injured party was not a party to the incidental contract of salebecomes irrelevant and his title to sue the manufacturer is unaffected by that circumstance. Theappellant in the present instance asks that her case be approached as a case of delict not as a caseof breach of contract. She does not require to invoke the exceptional cases in which a person not aparty to a contract has been held to be entitled to complain of some defect in the subject matter ofthe contract which has caused him harm. The exceptional case of things dangerous in themselves orknown to be in a dangerous condition has been regarded as constituting a peculiar category outsidethe ordinary law both of contract and of tort. I may observe that it seems to me inaccurate todescribe the case of dangerous things as an exception to the principle that no one but a party to acontract can sue on that contract. I rather regard this type of case as a special instance ofnegligence where the law exacts a degree of diligence so stringent as to am ount practically to a\nguarantee of safety.\nWith these preliminary observations I turn to the series of English cases which is said to compose\nthe consistent body of authority on which we are asked to non-suit the appellant. It w ill be f ound\nthat in most of them the facts were very different from the facts of the present case and did not giverise to the special relationship and consequent duty which in my opinion is the deciding factor here.Dixon v. Bell , 1816, 5 M. & S. 198 is the starting point. There a maidservant was sent to fetch a\ngun from a neighbour's house; on the way back she pointed it at a child and the gun went off andinjured the child. The owner of the gun was held liable for the injury to the child on the ground thathe should have seen that the charge was drawn before he entrusted the gun to the maid-servant. \"Itwas incumbent on him who, by charging the gun, had made it capable of doing mischief, to render itsafe and innoxious.\" This case in my opinion merely illustrates the high degree of care, am ounting\nin effect to insurance against risk, which the law exacts from those who take the responsib ility of\ngiving out such dangerous things as loaded firearms. The decision if it has any relevance isfavourable to the appellant who submits that human drink rendered poisonous by carelesspreparation may be as dangerous to life as any loaded firearm.

The ground ofthe decision seems to have been that there was a false representation by the vendor that the gunwas safe, and the representation appears to have been held to extend to the purchaser's son. Thecase is treated by commentators as turning on its special circumstances and as not deciding anyprinciple of general application. As for Winterbottom v.

There was a sale in thatcase by a chemist of some hair wash to a purchaser for the use of his wife, who suffered injury fromusing it by reason of its having been negligently compounded. As Kelly C.B. points out the actionwas not founded on any warranty implied in the contract of sale between the vendor and thepurchaser, and the plaintiff, the purchaser's wife, was not seeking to sue on the contract to whichshe was not a party.

I may mention in passing that Lord Atkinson in thisHouse speaking of that case and Langridge v. Levy (cit. sup.) observed that \"in both these latter\ncases the defendant represented that the article sold was fit and proper for the purposes for which itwas contemplated that it should be used and the party injured was ignorant of its unfitness for thesepurposes.\" It is true that George v. Skiving ton. has been the subject of some criticism and was saidby Hamilt on, J., as he then was, in Blacker v. Lake & Elliot , 1912, 106 L.T. 533, to have been in\nlater cases as nearly disaffirmed as is possible without being expressly overruled. I am not sure thatit has been so severely, handled as that. At any rate I do not think that it deserved to be andcertainly, so far as I am aware, it has never been disapproved in this House. It has been cited in ajudgment of the Privy Council by Lord Dunedin without any indication of disapproval (DominionNatural Gas Co. v. Collins [ 1909], A.C. 640, at p. 646). Heaven v. Fender, 1883, 11 Q.B.D. 503,\nhas probably been more quoted and discussed in this branch of the law than any other authority,because of the dicta of Sir Baliol Brett, M.R., as he then was. on the general principles regulatingliability to third parties. In his opinion \"it may safely be affirmed to be a true pr oposition\" that\n\"whenever one person is by circumstances placed in such a position with regard to another thateveryone of ordinary sense who did think would at once recognise that if he did not use ordinarycare and skill in his own c onduct with regard to those circumstances he would cause danger of\ninjury to the person or property of the other, a duty arises to use ordinary care and skill to avoidsuch danger.\" The passage specially applicable to the present case is as follows:\n\"Whenever one person supplies goods \u2026 for the purpose of their being used by\nanother person under such circumstances that everyone of ordinary sense would, if hethought, recognise at once that unless he used ordinary care and sk ill with regard to the\ncondition of the thing supplied or the mode of supplying it there w ill be danger of\ninjury to the person or property of him for whose use the thing is supplied and who isto use it, a duty arises to use ordinary care and skill as to the c ondition or manner of\nsupplying such thing. And for a neglect of such ordinary care or sk ill whereby injury\nhappens a legal liability arises, to be enforced by an action for negligence.\"\nCotton, L.J., with whom Bowen, L.J., agreed, expressed himself as \"unw illing to concur with the\nMaster of the Rolls in laying down unnecessarily the larger principle which he entertains inasmuchas there are many cases in which the principle was impliedly negatived,\" but the decision of theCourt of Appeal was unanimously in the plaintiff's favour. The passages I have quoted like allattempts to formulate principles of law compendiously and exhaustively may be open to somecriticism and their universality may require some qualification but as enunciations of general legaldoctrine I am prepared, like Lord Hunter, to accept them as sound guides.

The negligence, if negligence therewas, was too remote and the practical consequences of affirming liability in such a case wereconsidered to be such as would render it difficult to carry on a trade at all. No prudent man,saysMathew, L.J., \"would contract to make or repair what the employers intended to permit others touse in the way of his trade. The species facti in that case seems to me to differ widely from the\ncircumstances of the present case where the manufacturer has specifically in view the use andconsumption of his products by the consumer and where the retailer is merely the vehicle oftransmission of the products to the consumer and by the nature of the products is precluded frominspecting or interfering with them in any way.

It related to a brazinglamp which, by exploding owing to a latent defect, injured a person other than the purchaser of itand the vendor was held not liable to the party injured. There appears to have been some differenceof opinion between Hamilt on, J., and Lush, J., who heard the case in the Divisional Court, as to\nwhether the lamp was an inherently dangerous thing.

This question was answered, in the negative. So far\nas negligence was concerned, it may well have been regarded as too remote, for I find thatHamilt on, J., used these words at p. 537 :\u2014\n\"In the present case all that can be said is that the defendants did not know that their\nlamp was not properly safe and had no reason to believe that it was not so, in the sensethat no one had drawn their attention to the fact, but that had they been wiser men ormore experienced men they would then have known what the plaintiff's experts saythat they ought to have known.\"\nI should doubt indeed if that is really a finding of negligence at all. The case on its facts is very far\nfrom the present one and if any principle of general application can be derived from it adverse tothe appellant's contention I should not be disposed to approve of such principle. I may add that inWhite v. Steadman [1913] 3 K.B., 340, at p. 348, I find that Lush, J., who was a party to thedecision in Blacker v. Lake & Elliot t, expressed the view \"that a person who has the means of\nknowledge and only does not know that the animal or 'chattel which he supplies is dangerousbecause he does not take ordinary care to avail himself of his opportunity of knowledge is inprecisely the same position as the person who knows\". As for Bates v. Batey & Co. , Ltd., cit. sup.,\nwhere a ginger beer bottle burst owing to a defect in it which though unknown to the manufacturerof the ginger beer could have been discovered by him by the exercise of reasonable care, HorridgeJ., there held that the plaintiff, who bought the bottle of ginger beer from a retailer to whom themanufacturer had sold it and who was injured by its explosion, had no right of action against themanufacturer. The case does not advance matters for it really turns upon the fact that themanufacturer did not know that the bottle was defective and this in the view of Horridge J., as heread the authorities, was enough to absolve the manufacturer. I would observe that in a true case ofnegligence knowledge of the existence of the defect causing damage is not an essential element atall.\nThis summary survey is sufficient to show what more detailed study confirms that the current of\nauthority has by no means always set in the same direction. In addition to George v. Skivington cit.\nsup. there is the American case of Thomas v. Winchester , 1852, 6 N.Y ., 397, which has met with\nconsiderable acceptance in this country and which is distinctly on the side of the appellant. There achemist carelessly issued in response to an order for extract of dandelion, a bottle containingbelladonna which he labelled extract of dandelion, with the consequence that a third party whotook a dose from the bottle suffered severely. The chemist was held responsible. This case is quotedby Lord Dunedin in giving the judgment of the Privy Council in Dominion Natural Gas Co. v.\nCollins (cit. sup.) as an instance of liab ility to third parties and I think it was a s ound decision.\nIn the American Courts the law has advanced considerably in the development of the principle\nexemplified in Thomas v. Winchester . In one of the latest cases in the United States, Macpherson v.\nBuick Motor Co ., 1916, 217 N.Y . 382, the plaintiff who had purchased from a retailer a motor car\nmanufactured by the defendant company was injured in consequence of a defect m theconstruction of the car and was held entitled to recover damages from the manufacturer. Cardozo,J., the very eminent Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals, and now an Associate Justiceof the United States Supreme Court, thus stated the law :\n\"There is no claim that the defendant knew of the defect and wilfully concealed it. \u2026\nThe charge is one, not of fraud, but of negligence.

The law does not lead us to soinconsequent a conclusion. \"\nThe prolonged discussion of English and American cases into which I have been led might well\ndispose your Lordships to think that I had forgotten that the present is a Scottish appeal which mustbe decided according to Scots law. But this discussion has been rendered inevitable by the course ofthe argument at your Lordships' bar which, as I have said, proceeded on the footing that the lawapplicable to the case was the same in England and Scotland. Having regard to the inconclusivestate of the authorities in the courts below and to the fact that the important question involved isnow before your Lordships for the first time I think it desirable to consider the matter from thepoint of view of the principles applicable to this branch of law which are admittedly common toboth English and Scottish jurisprudence.\nThe law takes no cognisance of carelessness in the abstract. It concerns itself with carelessness only\nwhere there is a duty to take care and where failure in that duty has caused damage. In suchcircumstances carelessness assumes the legal quality of negligence and entails the consequences inlaw of negligence. What then are the circumstances which give rise to this duty to take care ? In thedaily contacts of social and business life human beings are thrown into or place themselves in aninfinite variety of relationships with their fellows and the law can refer only to the standards of thereasonable man in order to determine whether any particular relationship gives rise to a duty to takecare as between those who stand in that relationship to each other. The grounds of action may be asvarious and manifold as human errancy and the conception of legal responsib ility may develop in\nadaptation to altering social conditions and standards. The criterion of judgment must adjust andadapt itself to the changing circumstances of life. The categories of negligence are never closed.The cardinal principle of liability is that the party complained of s hould owe to the party\ncomplaining a duty to take care and that the party complaining should be able to prove that he hassuffered damage in consequence of a breach of that duty. Where there is room for diversity of viewis in determining what circumstances will establish such a relationship between the parties as togive rise on the one side to a duty to take care and on the other side to a right to have care taken Todescend from these generalities to the circumstances of the present case I do not think that anyreasonable man or any twelve reasonable men would hesitate to hold that if the appellantestablishes her allegations the respondent has exhibited carelessness in the conduct of his business.For a manufacturer of aerated water to store his empty bottles in a place where snails can getaccess to them and to fill his bottles wit hout taking any adequate precautions by inspection or\notherwise to ensure that they contain no deleterious foreign matter may reasonably be characterisedas carelessness without applying too exacting a standard. But, as I have pointed out, it is not enoughto prove the respondent to be careless in (his process of manufacture. The question is, does he owea duty to take care, and to whom does he owe that duty? Now I have no hesitation in affirming thata person who for gain engages in the business of manufacturing articles of food and drink intendedfor consumption by members of the public in the form in which he issues them is under a duty totake care in the manufacture of these articles. That duty, in my opinion, he owes to those whom heintends to consume his products. He manufactures his commodities for human consumption; heintends and contemplates that they shall be consumed. By reason of that very fact he places himselfin a relationship with all the potential consumers of his commodities and that relationship which heassumes and desires for this own ends imposes upon him a duty to take care to avoid injuring them.He owes them a duty not to convert by his own carelessness an article which he issues to them aswholesome and innocent into an article which is dangerous to life and health.

I cannot believe, and I do not\nbelieve, that neither in the law of England nor in the law of Scotland is there redress for such acase. The state of facts I have figured might well give rise to a criminal charge and the civilconsequence of such carelessness can scarcely be less wide than its criminal consequences. Yet theprinciple of the decision appealed from is that the manufacturer of food products intended by himfor human consumption does not owe to the consumers whom he has in view any duty of care, noteven the duty to take care that he does not poison them.\nMy Lords, the recognition by counsel that the law of Scotland applicable to the case was the same\nas the law of England implied that there was no special doctrine of Scots law which either theappellant or the respondent could invoke to support her or his case and your Lordships have thusbeen relieved of the necessity of a separate consideration of the law of Scotland. For myself I amsatisfied that there is no specialty of Scots law involved and that the case may safely be decided onprinciples common to both systems. I am happy to think that in their relation to the practicalproblem of everyday life which this appeal presents the legal systems of the two countries are in noway at variance and that the principles of both alike are sufficiently consonant with justice andcommon sense to admit of the claim which appellant seeks to establish.\nI am anxious to emphasise that the principle of judgment which commends itself to me does not\ngive rise to the sort of objection stated by Parke, B., at p. 768, in Longmeid v Holliday (cit. sup.),\nwhere he said :-\n\"But it would be going much too far to say that so much care is required in the ordinary\nintercourse of life between one individual and another that if a machine, not in itsnature dangerous, a carriage for instance, but which might become so by a latent defectentirely unknown although discoverable by the exercise of ordinary care should be lentor given by one person, even by the person who manufactured it to another, the formershould be answerable to the latter for a subsequent damage accruing by the use of it.\"\nI read this passage rather as a note of warning that the standard of care exacted in human dealings\nwith each other must not be pitched too high, than as giving any countenance to the view thatnegligence may be exhibited with impunity. It must always be a question of circumstances whetherthe carelessness amounts to negligence and whether the injury is not too remote from thecarelessness. I can readily conceive that where a manufacturer has parted with his product and ithas passed into other hands it may well be exposed to vicissitudes which may render it defective ornoxious and for which the manufacturer could not in any view be held to be to blame. It may be agood general rule to regard responsib ility as ceasing when control ceases. So also where between\nthe manufacturer and the user there is interposed a party who has the means and opportunity ofexamining the manufacturer's product before he re-issues it to the actual user. But where as in thepresent case the article of consumption is so prepared as to be intended to reach the consumer inthe condition in which it leaves the manufacturer and the manufacturer takes steps to ensure this bysealing or otherwise closing the container, so that the contents cannot be tampered with, I regard hiscontrol as remaining effective until the article reaches the consumer and the container is opened byhim. The intervention of any exterior agency is intended to be excluded and was in fact in thepresent case excluded. It is doubtful whether in such a case there is any redress against the retailer (Gordon v.
